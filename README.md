# Aave Price Feeds

This repository contains custom oracle adapters used when plain Chainlink pricing is not correct and/or not enough for Aave risk requirements.

## Examples

![Price Cap adapters architecture](./images/price-cap-adapters.png)

- LSTs with rate-based caps (wstETH, rsETH, weETH, ezETH, osETH)
- Stablecoins with fixed caps (USDC, USDT, EURC, RLUSD)
- Composed feeds for non-direct pairs (e.g. asset/ETH and ETH/USD to derive asset/USD)
- Pendle PT pricing with time-decaying discount
- Custom transforms such as discounted MKR from SKY or fixed-price adapters

## Adapter types

### RatioCapAdapter (LSTs)

For Liquid Staking Tokens (wstETH, rETH, weETH, etc.) that grow in value over time.

- Price capped based on maximum allowed yearly growth rate
- Uses snapshot ratio and timestamp as reference values to determine growth since then
- Returns capped ratio if current ratio exceeds calculated maximum

**Base contract:** [`PriceCapAdapterBase`](./src/contracts/PriceCapAdapterBase.sol)—see [detailed documentation](./src/contracts/README.md)

### FixCapAdapter (stablecoins)

For USD-pegged stablecoins (USDC, USDT, DAI) with fixed 1:1 peg.

- Price capped at a single configured maximum value (e.g., $1.04 for 4% cap)
- Returns capped price if current price exceeds the fixed maximum

**Contract:** [`PriceCapAdapterStable`](./src/contracts/PriceCapAdapterStable.sol)

### Synchronicity adapters

Combine two price feeds to derive a third pair.

- Does not cap the price derived from the feed's composition

| Adapter                                                                                            | Input Feeds         | Output    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| [`CLSynchronicityPriceAdapterBaseToPeg`](./src/contracts/CLSynchronicityPriceAdapterBaseToPeg.sol) | Asset/USD + ETH/USD | Asset/ETH |
| [`CLSynchronicityPriceAdapterPegToBase`](./src/contracts/CLSynchronicityPriceAdapterPegToBase.sol) | Asset/ETH + ETH/USD | Asset/USD |

### Specialized adapters

| Adapter                                                                                | Purpose                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [`PendlePriceCapAdapter`](./src/contracts/PendlePriceCapAdapter.sol)                   | PT tokens with linear discount decay     |
| [`CLRatePriceCapAdapter`](./src/contracts/CLRatePriceCapAdapter.sol)                   | Generic Chainlink rate-based cap         |
| [`DiscountedMKRSKYAdapter`](./src/contracts/misc-adapters/DiscountedMKRSKYAdapter.sol) | MKR price from SKY with dynamic discount |
| [`FixedPriceAdapter`](./src/contracts/misc-adapters/FixedPriceAdapter.sol)             | Hardcoded fixed price                    |

## Development

> [!NOTE]
> The contracts in this repository use the Shanghai EVM version, please check network support before deploying.

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Run tests (unit and adapter/fork tests)
make test

# Run report generator tests
pnpm run vitest
```

## CAPO report generator

`BaseTest` generates CAPO markdown reports during retrospective tests.

- Input snapshot: `./reports/out/<REPORT_NAME>.json` (temporary)
- Output report: `./reports/out/<REPORT_NAME>.md`

The generator script is [`reports/capo-report.ts`](./reports/capo-report.ts) and is executed through FFI:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx ./reports/capo-report.ts -i ./reports/mocks/capo.json -o ./reports/out/capo.md
```

## Adding new adapters

See [how-to.md](./how-to.md) for detailed instructions on adding LST or stablecoin adapters.

## Aave V4 compatibility

The Aave v3 Oracle and the current Aave v4 Oracle both consume `latestAnswer()` function. When registering a price source, the Aave V4 Oracle also calls `decimals()` function and [requires the price source's decimals to match the Oracle's decimals](https://github.com/aave/aave-v4/blob/496200b791c02e4a009188fc48448d11f2eef3c6/src/spoke/AaveOracle.sol#L48).

The `latestRoundData()` function is not required by the Aave V4 Oracle. Adapters may still implement [`IExtendedFeed`](./src/interfaces/IExtendedFeed.sol) to expose it for compatibility with other consumers; see [`OneUSDFixedAdapter.sol`](./src/contracts/misc-adapters/OneUSDFixedAdapter.sol) for an example.

## Repository history

> [!NOTE]  
> Following the [Multichain Strategy Proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-focussing-the-aave-v3-multichain-strategy-phase-1/23954), Soneium and zkSync scripts and tests have been removed from this repository. For deployed adapter addresses, please consult the [address-book](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-address-book) repository.

- The original contracts of this repository were developed inside the
  [CL Synchronicity Price Adapter](https://github.com/bgd-labs/cl-synchronicity-price-adapter) repository.
- They were later moved and improved in the [Aave Capo](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-capo) repository.
- The [Aave Capo](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-capo) repository was later renamed to
  [Aave Price Feeds](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-price-feeds) to better reflect its purpose.
